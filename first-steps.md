# There should be basically nothing to it #

(as far as the user is concerned)

```python

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
  return "Hello World!"

```

#So: #

```javascript


route("/").on("GET", hello_world)

function hello_world(){
  return "Hello World!"
}

```

[This is basically how it works, now](current.md)
